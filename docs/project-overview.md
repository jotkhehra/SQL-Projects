# Project Overview

This document provides an overview of the SQL projects included in this repository. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL and my ability to analyze, manipulate, and maintain data efficiently.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. Employee Data Management and Analysis
- **Objective**: Automate and manage employee data while deriving insights about salary trends, job satisfaction, and demographics.
- **Key Highlights**:  
  - Designed stored procedures for employee data insertion and validation.  
  - Analyzed salary distributions using median, mode, and aggregate calculations.  
  - Used advanced SQL techniques like CASE statements and JOINs for reporting.  

### 2. Audit and Validation Framework
- **Objective**: Ensure data integrity and create a comprehensive audit trail for critical database operations.
- **Key Highlights**:  
  - Developed triggers to log and validate data changes in employee compensation.  
  - Maintained an audit trail with details of old and new values, transaction types, and timestamps.  
  - Employed autonomous transactions to ensure secure logging.  

### 3. Staff Compensation and Reporting
- **Objective**: Manage staff compensation dynamically and provide detailed reports on total compensation and role-based trends.
- **Key Highlights**:  
  - Automated commission calculations for various job roles using stored procedures.  
  - Analyzed individual and role-based compensation trends.  
  - Created reusable functions for specific tasks like formatted name outputs and vowel counts in text fields.  

### 4. Encapsulated Operations with PL/SQL Packages
- **Objective**: Provide a modular approach for managing staff operations by encapsulating procedures and functions in packages.
- **Key Highlights**:  
  - Encapsulated key operations such as staff addition, commission updates, and compensation calculations.  
  - Enhanced code reusability and maintainability through modular design.  

## üåü Skills Demonstrated
- Database automation through triggers and procedures.
- Advanced SQL queries for trend analysis and data manipulation.
- Modular programming with PL/SQL packages.
- Auditing and data validation mechanisms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **SQL Developer**
- **MySQL**
- **Oracle PL/SQL**

## üìå How to Run the Projects
1. Set up the schema using the `ot_schema.sql` file in the `datasets/` folder.
2. Load the sample data using the `ot_data.sql` file.
3. Run the SQL scripts in the `sql-scripts/` folder to explore the functionality.
